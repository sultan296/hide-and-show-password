# hide-and-show-password

I begin by setting up the basic HTML structure, linking it to a CSS file for styling. I then create an input field of type "password," which users can interact with. To enhance the user experience, I add an eye icon that, when clicked, toggles the visibility of the password entered. This is achieved through a simple JavaScript function that checks the current input type and switches it between "password" and "text."
